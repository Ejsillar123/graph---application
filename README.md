# RouteFinder Application
Introduction

-The RouteFinder application demonstrates a simple and practical implementation of graph structures. It is designed to help users find the shortest path between two locations in a network of connected points. This application uses a graph data structure where nodes represent locations and edges represent connections (roads, pathways, or routes).

What It Can Do

-Add Locations: Users can add nodes to the graph, representing new locations.

-Add Connections: Users can define paths between locations with weights, representing distances or costs.

-Display Graph: The app can display all the locations and their connections.

-Find Shortest Path: Using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the app finds the shortest path between two specified locations.

Why I made this Application

This application provides practical application of graph theory in real-world applications, offering a basic route-planning feature for real-world systems, enhancing understanding for students and developers.
